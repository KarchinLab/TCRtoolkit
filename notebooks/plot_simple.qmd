In this notebook, you can see plots showing basic T cell repertoire statistics.

# Import libraries

```{python}
import os
from IPython.display import Image
```

# Sample level statistics

Below are plots showing basic T cell repertoire statistics. Each plot has a simple description about the statistic shown. However, biological interpretation of each plot is left to the user.

## Number of clones

```{python}

```{python}
## display the num_clones.png image
Image(filename='num_clones.png')
```

**Figure 1. Number of clones across timepoints.** The number of clones in each sample is shown. A clone is defined as a T cell with a unique CDR3 amino acid sequence. The number of clones is shown on the y-axis and the timepoint is shown on the x-axis. Left: Boxplot, Right: matched paitent line plot.

## Clonality

```{python}
## display the clonality.png image
Image(filename='clonality.png')
```

**Figure 2. The clonality of samples across timepoints.** Clonality is a measure of T cell clonal expansion and reflects the degree to which the sample is dominated by 1 or more T cell clones. Clonality is calculated as: *Clonality = 1 - entropy(clone_counts) / log2(number of clones)*. Left: Boxplot, Right: matched paitent line plot.

## Simpson Index

```{python}
## display simpson_index_corrected.png image
Image(filename='simpson_index_corrected.png')
```

**Figure 3. Corrected Simpson Index.** The Simpson Index is a measure of diversity that takes into account the number of clones and the relative abundance of each clone in a sample. The corrected Simpson Index is calculated as: *Corrected Simpson Index = sum(clone_counts\*(clone_counts-1)) / (number of TCRs\*(number of TCRs-1))*. Left: Boxplot, Right: matched paitent line plot.

## Percent of productive TCRs

```{python}
## display pct_prod.png image
Image(filename='pct_prod.png')
```

**Figure 4. Percent of productive TCRs.** A productive TCR is a DNA/RNA sequence that can be translated into a protein sequence, i.e. it does not contain a premature stop codon or an out of frame rearrangement. The percent of productive TCRs is calculated as: *Percent productive TCRs = number of productive TCRs / number of TCRs*. Left: Boxplot, Right: matched paitent line plot.

## Average CDR3 Length

```{python}
## display cdr3_len.png image
Image(filename='cdr3_avg_len.png')
```

**Figure 5. Average CDR3 Length** The average length of the CDR3 region of the TCR. The CDR3 region is the most variable region of the TCR and is the region that determines antigen specificity. Left: Boxplot, Right: matched paitent line plot.

# Execution environment

```{python}
print(os.system('mamba env export --no-builds'))
```
